## User-Centered Design
- Understand users
- Establish requirements
- Design, prototype and build
- Evaluate

## Why carry out user research?
- Understand user values, priorities and behaviors
- listen to what people want and need
- get users involved at an early stage in the process
- seek regular feedback from users throughout the design process
## User Research Methods
###### Asking People
- interviews
- focus groups
- questionnaires/surveys
###### Observing People
- observing 'in the field'
- controlled observation studies
- indirect observation
	user diaries/design probes logs & analytics biometric measures


## Interview types
- Unstructured : exploratory conversation with no script
- Semi-structured : guide questions but follow-ups allowed
- Structured : tightly scripted with no deviation

## Pros & Cons Interviews
| pros                                                     |     | cons                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| good for  understanding wants, needs, values, priorities |     | less useful when users 'don't know what they know'       |
| versatile and flexible                                   |     | difficult when users are shy                             |

| collect rich data                                        |     | people can be less likely to raise problems face to face |

## Pros & Cons Focus Groups

| can be an efficient way of hearing from more people |     | success depends on skill of facilitator    |
| good for community issues                           |     | less in-depth individual beliefs           |

## Pros & Cons Questionnaires
| pros                              |     | cons                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------- |
| can reach large numbers of people |     | limited opportunity for follow up questions |
| cost efficient                    |     | may lack richness                           |
| can be quick                      |     | can't clarify/correct misunderstandings     |
| easy to repeat                    |     | people may give up halfway through          |

## Good Questions
- can be open or closed:
	- open: which websites do you visit regularly?
	- closed: which of these websites do you visit regularly?
		- amazon.co.uk
		- bbc.co.uk
- ask about specifics: who, what, when, where, why, how?
- use open probes at the end: do you want to tell me anything else?
- it is also a good practice to summarize the interviewee's responses

## Observation
- early in design:
	- understand users' context, tasks, goals
- later in development:
	- understand how the prototype supports these goals

## Structuring Frameworks
three easy-to-remember parts:
- the person: who is using the technology at any particular time?
- the place: where are they using it?
- the thing; what are they doing with it?

## Planning and Conducting Observation In The Field
- Decide on how involved you will be: passive observer to active participant 
- How to gain acceptance
- How to handle sensitive topics, e.g. culture, private spaces, etc.
- How to collect the data:
	- what data to collect 
	- what equipment to use
	- when to stop observing

## Pros & Cons Observation
| pros                                                                      |     | cons                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------------- |
| can discover things users can't express easily e.g. unconscious behaviors |     | can be costly and time consuming  |
| fills in details and allows you to get a rich picture                     |     | potentially invasive              |
| helps you understand the context you are designing for                    |     | can generate vast amounts of data |
## Indirect Observation User Diaries & Probes
- asking users to record their thoughts, ideas and experiences using a paper/digital, audio/video or photo diary
- can be used to gather information about their daily life, or their use of a device
- can deliver rich data, but little control over what is recorded beyond initial prompts

## Web Analytics
a system of tools and techniques for optimizing web usage by:
- measuring
- collecting
- analyzing 
- reporting web data
typically focus on the number of web visitors and page views. Example: Google Analytics

## Pros & Cons Logs & Analytics
| pros                                                           |     | cons                                                                                                                           |

| allows researchers to reach an extremely large number of users |     | data gathered can lack context: we know a lot about what and when, a little about who and where, but hardly anything about why |
| cost effective                                                 |     |                                                                                                                                |
## Biometrics
- the study and use of measurable biological characteristics
- sensors allow the measurement of different biological readings from participants, e.g.:
	- galvanic skin response
	- heart rate
	- eye movements
	- Electroencephalography (EEG)

## Ethics
- whenever you are working with real users you need to consider ethical issues
- what ethical concerns might there be in HCI?
	- participant anonymity 
	- informed consent
	- user expectations
	- safety
	- persuasion/manipulation
