Happy birthday to my special one, can't believe you are 22 now. So old.... 

I just want to let you know that I am never letting you go and keep annoying you, even on your birthday. So, I am very lucky to have you, seriously.  

We are in a bit of an undefined relationship, but I am very comfortable and I hope the same goes for you. I am very glad that we didn't let each other just go, otherwise I wouldn't have built such unfiltered relationship with you (primarily the shitting in front of you bit).

I want you to know that you are an amazing person and you deserve all of the love and happiness that come your way. The warmth you bring to my life is immeasurable and priceless. I would love to keep waking you up every morning despite you being moody as hell. 

Enough of the cheesy message. You are about to start your VERY VERY important LAB. I have no worries for you, but i know it will probably give you tough time from time to time. I hope I can be your support through it, even though I might annoy you a lil. Just a little bit.

Love you. Taisei
