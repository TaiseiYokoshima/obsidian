### Key Security Concepts 
1. Confidentiality 
	Keeping sensitive data confidential through means of encryption and only allow authorized  access and disclosure. While concealing means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information
	
2. Integrity 
	Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including mechanism to prove that the data has not been tempered with.
	
3. Availability 
	Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information 

4. Authenticity 
	The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, message or message originator. Requires verifying users checking the origin of each input. 

5. Accountability 
	Providing the capability of actions being traced to their originator. Supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention. Records are kept to provide post-attack analysis and meet legal requirements 

#### Categories of vulnerabilities 
- Corrupted (loss of integrity)
- Leaky (loss of confidentiality)
- Unavailable or very slow (loss of  availability)
#### Threats 
- Capable of exploiting vulnerabilities 
- Represent potential security harm to an asset 
#### Attacks 
- Passive - attempt to learn or make use of information from the system that does not affect system resources 
- Active - attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation 
- Insider - initiated by an entity inside the security parameter 
- Outsider - initiated from outside the perimeter 

## Countermeasures

##### Means used to deal with security attacks 
- Prevent 
- Detect 
- Recover 
##### Residual vulnerabilities may remain
##### May itself introduce new vulnerabilities 
##### Goal is to minimize residual level of risk to the assets
