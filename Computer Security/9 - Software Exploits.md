# Security Flaws
Critical web application security flaws include:
- unvalidated input
- cross-site scripting (xss)
- buffer overflow
- injection flaws
- improper error handling

# Interpretation of Program Input
Program input may be binary or text
- binary interpretation depends on encoding and is usually application specific
There is an increasing variety of character sets being used
- Care is needed to identify just which set is being used and what characters are being read
Failure to validate may result in an exploitable vulnerability 

# Validating Input Syntax
1. ensure data confirm with assumptions 
2. compare against what is wanted
3. compare against dangerous values
4. only accept known safe data
