# Requirements for Public-Key Cryptosystems
- Computationally easy to create key pairs
- Computationally easy for sender knowing public key to encrypt messages
- Computationally easy for receiver knowing private key to decrypt cipher text
- Computationally infeasible for opponent to determine private key from public key
- Computationally infeasible for opponent to otherwise recover original message
- Useful if either key can be used for each role


# Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
- RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
	- Developed in 1977
	- Most widely accepted and implemented approach to public-key encryption 
	- Block cipher in which the plain text and cipher text are integers between 0 and n - 1 for some n.
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm
	- Enables two users to securely reach agreement about a shared secret that can be used as a secret key for subsequent symmetric encryption of messages
	- Limited to the exchange of the keys
- Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
	- Provides only a digital signature function with SHA-1
	- Cannot be used for encryption or key exchange
- Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
	- Security like RSA, but with much smaller keys


# Digital Signatures
- NIST FIPS PUB 186-4 defines a digital signature as:
	"The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that, when properly implemented, provides a mechanism for verifying origin authentication, data integrity and signatory non-repudiation."
- Thus, a digital signature is a data-dependent bit pattern, generated by an agent as a function of a file, message, or other form of data block
- FIPS 186-4 specifies the use of one of three digital signature algorithms:
	- Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
	- RSA Digital Signature Algorithm
	- Elliptic Curve Digital  Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)


# Random Numbers
Uses include generation of:
- Keys for public-key algorithms
- Stream key for symmetric stream cipher
- Symmetric key for use as a temporary session key or in creating a digital envelope
- Handshaking to prevent replay attacks (e.g., Kerberos)
- Session key


# Random Number Requirements
### Criteria:
- Uniform distribution
	- Frequency of occurrence of each of the numbers should be approximately the same
- Independence 
	- No one value in the sequence can be inferred from the others

### Unpredictability
- Each number is statistically independent of other numbers in sequence 
- Opponent should not be able to predict future elements of the sequence on the basis of earlier elements

# Random versus Pseudorandom 
- Cryptographic applications typically make use of algorithmic techniques for random number generation 
	- Algorithms are deterministic and therefore produce sequences of numbers that are not statistically random
- Pseudorandom numbers are:
	- Sequences produced that satisfy statistical randomness tests
	- Likely to be predictable
- True random number generator (TRNG):
	- Uses a nondeterministic source to produce randomness
	- Most operate by measuring unpredictable natural processes
		- e.g., radiation, gas discharge, leaky capacitors
	- Increasingly provided on modern processors
