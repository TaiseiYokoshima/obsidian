# How to design
### Need to take into account:
- who the users are
- what activities are being carried out
- where the interaction is taking place
Need to optimize the interactions users have with a product, so that they match the users' activities, needs, and wants 
### Understanding Users' needs
- need to take into account what people are good and bad at
- consider what might help people in the way they currently do things 
- think through what might provide quality user experiences
- listen to what people want and get them involved 
- use tried and tested user-centered methods
# User-centered design
- understand users
- evaluate
- establish requirements
- design, prototype and build
## Usability vs User Experience
- effective to use 
- efficient to use 
- safe to use
- has good utility 
- easy to learn 
- easy to remember how to use
### Donald Norman's Design Principles 
- visibility 
	functions that are visible make it easier for the user to know what to do next (and vice versa)
- feedback
	let users know the status of the system that an action has been performed successfully (or not)
- constraints 
	restricts the kinds of user interactions that can take place (either permanently or at a given point in time)
- mapping
	make sure the relationship between a control and its effect is clear
- consistency
	similar elements should have similar functions (or allow you to achieve similar tasks). allows people to discover patterns that they can apply to new situations 
- affordances 
	visual attribute that gives the user an idea of how to interact with it
