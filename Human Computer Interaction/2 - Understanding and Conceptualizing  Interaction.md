### Framework for analyzing the problem space
- are there problems with an existing product or user experience? if so, what are they?
- why do you think there are problems?
- how do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these?
- if you are designing for a new user experience, how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things?
### From Problem Space to Design Space
having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space
	e.g. what kind of interfaced, behavior, functionality to provide
but before deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model

## Conceptual Model
a conceptual model is:
	"...a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates" (Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p. 26)

### Interface metaphors
- an interface metaphor is a conceptual model instantiated at the interface.
- interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but which also has own properties - e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals, electronic calendars, online shopping 'basket'
- can be based on activity, object or a combination of both
### When Interface Metaphors Go Bad
- can break conventional and cultural rules (e.g.recycle bin placed on desktop)
- can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space
- can conflict with design principles
- can force users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor 
- designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over
- limit designers' imagination in coming up with new conceptual model
### Interaction types
- instructing : issuing commands and selecting options
- conversing : interacting with a system as if having a conversation
- manipulating : interacting with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them
- exploring : navigating through a virtual environment or a physical space

##### Instructing Pros & Cons

| pros                                     |     | cons                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------ |
| all commands are provided                |     | limited number of commands     |
| straightforward way of selecting options |     | no flexibility                 |
| quick & efficient                        |     | need to learn the instructions |
| good for repetitive tasks                |     |                                |
##### Conversing Pros & Cons

| pros                                                                                       |     | cons                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| designed to allow (novice/technophobe) users to interact with the system in a familiar way |     | misunderstandings can arise when the system does not know how to parse what the user says |
| hands free                                                                                 |     | can be annoying                                                                           |

##### Direct Manipulation Pros & Cons

| pros                                              |     | cons                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| novices can learn the basic functionality quickly |     | some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally              |
| error messages rarely needed                      |     | not all tasks can be described by objects, not all actions can be done directly |
| users can get direct feedback on their actions    |     | can be slower than function keys, command line                                  |
##### Exploring Pros & Cons

| pros                                                               |     | cons                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| can be really useful when people aren't sure what they want        |     | can take more time                                                        |
| good for games/entertainment, where the journey is part of the fun |     | needs very killed design to properly structure information and navigation |
| can provide a more immersive/engaging experience                   |     |                                                                           |
### Interface Types

## Conceptual models & user-centered design
##### choice of model (and/or metaphor) depends on what we know about:
- user characteristics: 
	- personas
	- observational studies
- user tasks
	- task description
	- task analysis
- user goals
	- scenario
	- use cases
